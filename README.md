## Basic DeepRacer Reinforcement Learning Model with GitHub CI/CD integration

This project involves creating a new model using AWS DeepRacer and using reward function and hyperparameters to train the model. It explores reinforcement learning to create a version-controlled environment for experimenting with AWS DeepRacer models. Beyond exploring the reinforcement learning aspects, it deploys the model and thereby establishes a foundation for advanced AI/ML racing experiments.
